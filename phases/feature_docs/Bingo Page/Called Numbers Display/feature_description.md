# Called Numbers Display (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes how the numbers called during a Bingo game are displayed to the user on a mobile device, specifically showing the most recently called number and previous numbers.

## Visual Elements
*   **Current Called Number:**
    *   Prominent, large display of the MOST recently called Bingo number.
*   **History of Called Numbers:**
    *   A list or scrolling display of previous numbers called in the current round.
*   **Visual/Auditory Cues:**
    *   Animation or sound effect when a new number is called.

## User Interaction
*   Users can quickly identify the current number.
*   Users can review past called numbers to ensure they haven't missed any.
*   Interface should be clear and not interfere with card interaction.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Current number display must be highly visible even if the user is focused on their card.
*   History list should be scrollable and not take up too much screen real estate.
*   Elements should dynamically adjust to portrait/landscape modes if supported.
