# User Profile Access (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes how users can view information about other players in the Lobby Page on a mobile device, potentially leading to user profile access.

## Visual Elements
*   **Player List Display:**
    *   A list showing other players in the lobby (e.g., "Player 1", "Player 2", "Player 3").
    *   Each player entry includes their associated coin amount (e.g., "1000 coins").
*   **Profile Icon/Avatar (potential future expansion):**
    *   A small, tappable icon (e.g., a generic person icon, user's avatar if set) typically located in a corner of the Lobby screen, possibly leading to the current user's own profile.
*   **Settings/Hamburger Menu (if profile is part of a larger menu):**
    *   A menu icon that expands to reveal options including "My Profile," "Settings," "Help," "Logout," etc.

## User Interaction
*   Users can see a list of other players currently in the lobby and their respective coin balances.
*   Tapping on a player's name (or a dedicated icon) could potentially lead the user to a more detailed profile page for that player or themselves.
*   The profile page should allow users to view/edit personal information, check game history, manage notifications, etc.

## Mobile Considerations
*   The player list should be clearly visible and scrollable if many players are present.
*   Icons and interactive elements should be easily tappable without being obstructive to the main Lobby content.
*   Consistent placement (e.g., top-left or top-right corner) for easy discoverability of one's own profile/settings.
*   Profile/settings screens should be well-organized and easy to navigate on a small screen.
