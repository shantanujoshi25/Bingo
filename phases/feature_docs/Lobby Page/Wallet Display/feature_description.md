# Wallet Display (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document details how the user's in-app wallet balance and other relevant currency/status indicators are displayed on the Lobby Page of the mobile application.

## Visual Elements
*   **Prominent Balance Display:**
    *   Clearly visible numerical display of the user's current credit/coin/currency balance.
    *   Appropriate currency symbol or icon.
    *   The term "Sapphire" is present, which may indicate the currency type or a user's VIP level.
*   **Player Coin Display:**
    *   Coin amounts are shown alongside player names (e.g., "1000 coins" for "Player 1"), indicating their current balance or stake.
*   **Access to Wallet Details:**
    *   A tappable area or button that leads to a more detailed wallet management screen (e.g., transaction history, deposit/withdrawal options).
*   **(Optional) Deposit/Add Funds Button:**
    *   A quick access button to add more funds to the wallet.

## User Interaction
*   Users can quickly see their current balance upon entering the Lobby.
*   Users can view the coin amounts of other players in the lobby.
*   Tapping the balance or a dedicated button navigates them to a full wallet management section.
*   (If available) Users can initiate a deposit process directly from the Lobby.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Balance should be easily scannable, often placed in a top corner or header.
*   Minimally intrusive, but always accessible.
*   Consistent placement across different screens if the wallet is a persistent element.
