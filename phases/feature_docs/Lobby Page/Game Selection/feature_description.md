# Game Selection (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes how users select and join different Bingo games or rooms from the Lobby Page on a mobile device. This includes the process of selecting custom numbers for a game.

## Visual Elements
*   **List of Available Games/Rooms:**
    *   Each game entry should display key information: game name/type, current number of players, start time (if scheduled), ticket price, prize pool, thumbnail image.
    *   Clear visual indication of game status (e.g., "Starting Soon," "Live," "Full").
*   **Number Selection Interface ("your NUMBERS"):**
    *   A dedicated section where users can select 9 unique numbers from 1 to 50.
    *   This selection is facilitated by scrollable input fields (represented as circles in the sketch).
    *   A "PLAY" button is present to finalize the selection and join the game.
*   **Filters/Sorting Options:**
    *   Options to filter games by type (e.g., 75-ball, 90-ball), price, start time.
    *   Sorting options (e.g., popular, newest, prize size).
*   **Search Bar:**
    *   Ability to search for specific game names.

## User Interaction
*   Users can scroll through the list of available games.
*   Tapping on a game entry should display more details (e.g., rules, specific prize breakdown) or lead directly to ticket purchase/game entry.
*   Users interact with the "your NUMBERS" section to choose their desired 9 unique numbers. The "PLAY" button becomes actionable once 9 unique numbers have been selected.
*   Filters and sorting should update the game list dynamically.
*   A clear call-to-action button (e.g., "Play Now," "Join Game") on each game entry or detail view.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Card-based or list-based layout optimized for touch scrolling.
*   Easy-to-tap elements for game selection and filtering.
*   Clear visual hierarchy to quickly convey game information.
*   The number selection interface should be intuitive and responsive to touch input.
