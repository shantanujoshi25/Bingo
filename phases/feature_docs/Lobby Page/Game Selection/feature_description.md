# Game Selection (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
One room where everyone joins. 

## Visual Elements
*   **List of Available Games/Rooms:**
    *   Clear visual indication of game status with a 15-second countdown before play starts.
    *   If the user has not selected 9 numbers during the 15-second countdown, then the room page refreshes.
*   **Number Selection Interface ("your NUMBERS"):**
    *   A dedicated section where users can select 9 unique numbers from 1 to 50.
    *   This selection is facilitated by scrollable input fields (similar to a slot machine).
    *   A "PLAY" button is present to finalize the selection and join the game.

## User Interaction
*   Users interact with the "NUMBERS" section to choose their desired 9 unique numbers.
*   The "PLAY" button becomes actionable ONLY once 9 unique numbers have been selected.
*   A clear PLAY button highlights when the user has selected 9 unique numbers.

## Mobile Considerations
*   List-based layout optimized for touch scrolling.
*   Easy-to-tap elements for number selection.
*   The number selection interface should be intuitive and responsive to touch input.
