## Feature Description
For now only have one room when everyone joins . 

## Visual Elements
*   **List of Available Games/Rooms:**
    *   Clear visual indication of game status (e.g., "Starting Soon," "Live," "Full").
*   **Number Selection Interface ("your NUMBERS"):**
    *   A dedicated section where users can select 9 unique numbers from 1 to 50.
    *   This selection is facilitated by scrollable input fields (similar to a slot machine/ scroll wheel).
    *   A "PLAY" button is present to finalize the selection and join the game.

## User Interaction
*   Users interact with the "your NUMBERS" section to choose their desired 9 unique numbers. The "PLAY" button becomes actionable once 9 unique numbers have been selected.
*   A clear call-to-action button (e.g., "Play Now," "Join Game") on each game entry or detail view.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Card-based or list-based layout optimized for touch scrolling.
*   Easy-to-tap elements for game selection and filtering.
*   Clear visual hierarchy to quickly convey game information.
*   The number selection interface should be intuitive and responsive to touch input.
